In my most recent job, I was a technical trainer. One common thread in all my positions has been the desire and need to inject automation everywhere I could, which drove me to learn basic scripting and coding on my own. I fell in love with code way back then, and that drove me to this career change.\n     \nNSS has given me the whole package - not just learning the languages, but more importantly, the 'soft skills' that employers demand today: how to learn new languages, problem deconstruction and problem-solving skills, a hunger for learning, being curious, not being afraid to ask for help, and a team mentality while still being independent - among others. For this, I am grateful to everyone at NSS and to my peers in Cohort 54. I would not have been as successful in this endeavor without you all. <br></br>I am now ready to put it all to the test; I think my security background coupled with my new developer skills will help make the applications I work on be more secure. So, I'm looking forward to joining an amazing team with a great company in my first role as a Software Engineer and continue my learning."
